# Video Editor: Setup

## Installation
Since Opencast 2.0 the videoeditor modules use ffmpeg for the prcessing. An ffmpeg version > 2.4 is hardly recommended-

## Configuration

### UI Config File Parameters

Currently there are two config file parameters for UI options.

The config file can be found at *etc/load/org.opencastproject.organization-mh_default_org.cfg*

1. prop.adminui.prePostRoll
    - Change the duration of the pre and post roll (in seconds)
2. prop.adminui.minSegmentLength
    - Change the minimum required segment length (in seconds)

### Silence Detection Config Parameters

The settings regarding the sensitivity of the silence detection can be changed in
*etc/services/org.opencastproject.silencedetection.impl.SilenceDetectionServiceImpl.properties*.

1. silence.pre.length
    - Duration of silence that should be included at the beginning of  a new voice segment. This is to avoid that a cut
      seems to sudden.
    - Default: 2000 (2s)
2. silence.threshold.db
    - Silence threshold in decibel (e.g. -50 for loud classrooms, -35 for silent indoor location).
    - Default: -40
3. silence.min.length
    - Minimum duration in milliseconds to detect a sequence as silence.
    - Default: 10000 (10s)
4. voice.min.length

    - Default: 60000 (1min)

### Video Editor Config Parameters

The ffmpeg properties for the Video Editor can be modified in
etc/services/org.opencastproject.videoeditor.impl.VideoEditorServiceImpl.properties. Usually there should be no reason
to touch this file.
