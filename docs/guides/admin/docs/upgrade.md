Upgrading Opencast 3.0 To 4.0
=============================

This guide describes how to upgrade Opencast 3.0.x to 4.0.x. In case you need information about how to upgrade older
versions of Opencast, please refer to the [old release notes](https://docs.opencast.org).


How to Upgrade
--------------

1. Download Opencast 4.0
2. Stop your current Opencast instance
3. Back-up Opencast files and database (optional)
4. [Upgrade the database](#database-migration)
5. Update the third party tools
6. Replace Opencast 3.0 with 4.0
7. Review the configuration changes and adjust your configuration accordingly
8. [Re-build the search indexes](#re-build-search-indexes)


Database Migration
------------------

Opencast 4.0 includes the following database changes:

1. AssetManager migration (MH-12082)

It should be needless to say that this migration should not take a lot of time and should be safe. Nevertheless, as with
all database migrations, we recommend to make a database backup before attempting the upgrade.

You can find the database upgrade script at `â€¦/docs/upgrade/3.0_to_4.0/mysql5.sql`.

### Standalone migration from Archive to AssetManager

The AssetManager replaces the Archive in Opencast 4.0

If you're setting up Opencast from scratch you can safely skip this document but if you plan to upgrade your system
and continue to use your data you should read on.

#### Database migration step by step

The AssetManager cannot work with an Archive database until it has been migrated. 

- Shutdown Opencast. Manual database intervention must not happen on a running system. 
- _Backup your database!_ Bad things might happen so you'd better be prepared.
- Open up a database shell, connect to the database with the respective Opencast user and apply these SQL scripts 
  in order:
    - `modules/matterhorn-asset-manager-impl/src/test/resources/mysql-migration-1.sql`
    - `modules/matterhorn-asset-manager-impl/src/test/resources/mysql-migration-2.sql`
    - `modules/matterhorn-asset-manager-impl/src/test/resources/mysql-migration-3.sql`
- Launch Opencast, go to the admin UI and check the data.     
  
In case of _any_ error restore from your backup.
