=============================

Welcome to the Matterhorn Universe! Matterhorn is an open-source enterprise
level lecture recording system. The core of the system delivers functionality

capture, Matterhorn provides capture agent software and third party appliances
are available. An awesome community provides new features and support.


The Software
