Supported Versions
==================

Opencast has a standing policy of supporting the current version, and the previous version.  In general terms, this means a roughly 1 year support cycle for any given release due to our release process (see the development process documentation in the developer wiki for more details).  Support, in this context, means development time - building fixes, applying them, and releasing those changes.  For example, as of the time of writing we currently support versions 3.0, and 2.3.  Once version 4.0 releases version 2.3 will no longer be supported, but 3.0 will.  This does not mean questions for older releases will not be answered!  Our community has a good track record of addressing issues and answering questions regarding older versions as best we can, but developer time will not be allocated to fixing additional issues.

Version differences
-------------------

While we strive to fix a bug in all supported versions, from time to time we encounter an issue where a bug is fixable in one version, but very difficult to fix in another.  In this case the bug may only be fixed in one version, even if both are still supported.

Extended support
----------------

At this time we are unable to offer additional support time due to developer resources.  This does not mean it is impossible to support a release for longer than two release cycles, only that we do not currently have the resources.  In the past community members have funded, or provided, additional support time themselves.  If you are in need of extended support we encourage you to reach out to the development community - there may be others in your situation who could share funding, or contractors available to provide this support.
