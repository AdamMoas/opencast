Opencast 5: Release Notes
=========================

New Features
------------

* **Paella Player** - The Paella Player is already well known in the Opencast community as external plugin, but now the
  player is finally integrated into Opencast's core. This makes switching players as easy as changing one configuration
  property. Additionally, the player's own configuration is now well integrated to enable tenant specific runtime
  configuration with no need to rebuild the player. Additional improvements include more translations as well as caption
  support.

* **Animate Service** - The Animate Opencast service can be used to generate custom animated video sequences which can
  use Opencast metadata like the author's name or the event's title. This is useful, for example, to automatically
  generate animated intro sequences to ensure having a homogeneous corporate design for all video recordings.

* **Live Scheduler Service** - With the Live Scheduler Service you will be able to schedule live events. The students
  can then watch the live stream during the recording is happen.

* **OAI-PMH Publication Service** - OAI-PMH Publication Service was created to simplify and unify the publishing process
  to the OAI-PMH repository. The metadata update handling was also improved in speed and robustness.

* **Moodle User/Role Provider** - The Moodle user/role provider allows to query Moodle users and their roles. The
  [Opencast tool](https://github.com/unirz-tu-ilmenau/moodle-tool_opencast) must be installed on the Moodle side.

* **New Workflow Operation Handlers**
    * **clone** - The [clone](workflowoperationhandlers/clone-woh.md) workflow operation can be used to clone media
      package elements.
    * **duplicate-event** - The [duplicate-event](workflowoperationhandlers/duplicate-event-woh.md) operation can be
      used to duplicate an event by copying an existing one.
    * **log** - The [log](workflowoperationhandlers/log-woh.md) workflow operation can be used to log the current state
      of of a workflow and/or its media package for testing and debugging purposes.
    * **animate** - The [animate](workflowoperationhandlers/animate-woh.md) workflow operation handler is the entry
      point to the Animate Service.
