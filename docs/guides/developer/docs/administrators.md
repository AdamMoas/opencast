Administrators
===========================

What is an administractor, and how does that differ from a committer?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

An administrator is someone within the Opencast community who has administrative access to one or more of our major
tools.  These tools are

 - JIRA
 - BitBucket
 - Google Groups
 - Crowdin
 - Github

While many of our administrators are committers, an administrator is _not_ a committer by necessity.  Administrators
have important responsibilities within the community, but mainly work behind the scenes.  These responsibilities
include:

 - Adding new committers to the relevant group(s)
 - Removing old committers from the relevant group(s)
 - Contacting support when required for hosted projects (Atlassian, Crowdin, Google)

Adding or removing Committers
-----------------------------

While the committer body manages its own membership, it does not directly have the power to add or remove users
from the appropriate groups across all of our hosted products.  Administrators are required to modify the various
groups in multiple places when a change is necessary.  These changes are

 - Modifying the [JIRA committers group](https://opencast.jira.com/admin/groups/view?groupname=committers-matterhorn)
 - Modifying the [BitBucket committers group](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/opencast-community/groups/opencast-committers/)
 - Modifying the [Google committers group](https://admin.google.com/opencast.org/AdminHome?hl=de&pli=1&fral=1&groupId=committers@opencast.org&chromeless=1#OGX:Group?hl=de)
 - Modifying the [Crowdin commiters group](https://crowdin.com/project/opencast-community/settings#members)
 - Modifying the [GitHub committers group](https://github.com/orgs/opencast/teams/committers/members) upon request
