# Setup

### Building Locally
The documentation is written in standard markdown. The tool that is used to build the documentation is [mkdocs.org](http://www.mkdocs.org/)

In order to build the documentation locally, you will need to [install MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation). Check out the documentation or use the following command

```
$ pip install mkdocs
```

From there, download the source of the documentation, go to the repo and use the following command to start a simple http server and build the doc:

```
$ mkdocs serve
```
