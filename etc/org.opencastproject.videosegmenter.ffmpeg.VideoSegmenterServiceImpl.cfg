# Configuration for the ffmpeg video segmentation properties

# Number of consecutive identical frames in a 1 frame-per-second movie that it
# takes in order to assume a new scene (defaults to 60).

#stabilitythreshold = 60

# Percentage of pixels that may change between two frames without considering
# them different (defaults to 0.025).

#changesthreshold = 0.025

# The number of segments that preferably should be generated (defaults to 30).

#prefNumber = 30

# The maximum error for the number of segments in percent. As soon as a segmentation with
# a lower error is achieved the optimization will be ended (defaults to 0.25).

#maxError = 0.25

# The number of cycles after which the optimization of the number of segments
# is forced to end (defaults to 3)
# (especially for videos with large filesizes a high value could lead to long
# runtimes of the optimization)

#maxCycles = 3

# An estimate of how much load the video segmenter puts on the node
# This job involves a number of ffmpeg processes to detect segments in the video
# This is both a CPU and I/O intensive job, so its load should reflect that
